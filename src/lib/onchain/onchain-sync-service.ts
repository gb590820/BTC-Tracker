/**
 * Reads the Bitcoin chain through an Esplora backend and turns what it finds
 * into `BitcoinTransaction` rows.
 *
 * The service is strictly read-only. It never builds, signs or broadcasts a
 * transaction, and it never asks for a private key: an xpub is enough to derive
 * every receive and change address, and esplora answers instantly for any
 * address, so no gap-limit *scan* is required.
 *
 * Three rules drive the whole design:
 *
 *  1. A txid is a natural key, unique per user (`@@unique([userId, txid])`), so a
 *     re-sync can never create a duplicate.
 *  2. Flows are aggregated per txid across *all* watched addresses before a row
 *     is written, so a transaction between two of the user's own wallets is one
 *     row, not two half-rows that would corrupt the portfolio.
 *  3. Every read and every write is scoped by `userId`. Watching a public address
 *     must not expose it to anybody else.
